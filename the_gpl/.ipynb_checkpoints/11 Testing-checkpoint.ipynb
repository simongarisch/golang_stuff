    "## Testing\n",
    "A great deal of effort has been spent on techniques to make this complexity manageable. Two techniques in particular stand out for their effectiveness. The first is routine peer review of programs before they are deployed. The second, the subject of this chapter, is testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The field of software testing is enormous. The task of testing occupies all programmers some of the time and some programmers all of the time. The literature on testing includes thousands of printed books and millions of words of blog posts. In every mainstream programming language, there are dozens of software packages intended for test construction, some with a great deal of theory, and the field seems to attract more than a few prophets with cult-like followings.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, writing test code is not much different from writing the original program itself. We write short functions that focus on one part of the task."

    "Within *_test.go files, three kinds of functions are treated specially: tests, benchmarks, and examples. A test function, which is a function whose name begins with Test, exercises some program logic for correct behavior; go test calls the test function and reports the result, which is either PASS or FAIL. A benchmark function has a name beginning with Benchmark and measures the performance of some operation; go test reports the mean execution time of the operation. And an example function, whose name starts with Example, provides machine-checked documentation."
