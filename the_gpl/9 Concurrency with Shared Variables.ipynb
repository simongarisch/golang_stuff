For best results, make sure that your tests exercise your packages using concurrency. Due to extra bookkeeping, a program built with race detection needs more time and memory to run, but the overhead is tolerable even for many production jobs. For infrequently occurring race conditions, letting the race detector do its job can save hours or days of debugging."
