Run Through Checklist
---
The table of contents should be visual. This makes it easy to understand how all the pieces fit together.

Instruction blocks should be single level lists. This is a readability issue.

Instruction blocks should have previous/next links.

Instruction blocks should be separated by horizontal rules.

Instruction blocks should end with a "check your work" screenshot.

Code excerpts should not have leading, trailing, or unnecessary ellipses.

Links should work (table of contents, previous/next links, localhost links).

Images should be in sync.

Dependencies should be minimized. We can't assume everyone knows SCSS or Bluebird, even though I would use those if this were a production app.

Alphabetize JS methods and requires.

Alphabetize CSS rules and declarations.

The code in the repo should exactly match the code in the tutorial.

We use `1.` only for Markdown lists.

Remove unused requires.
